<p align="justify">
My broad research goal is to improve software quality. To be more precise, I help developers produce software that is less maintenance-prone and more energy efficient ("green") at the same time.  
During my postdoctoral research (at UBC and UCalgary) I have focused on understanding software maintenance (e.g., predicting software bugs, and characterizing highly change-prone source code). I have also worked on constructing source code histories (<a href = "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9402063">CodeShovel<a>) that help developers find how and why a segment of source code evolved. My PhD research, on the other hand, focused on building models and tools to aid energy-aware app developers. For example, I have developed <a href = "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-018-9640-7">GreenScaler<a> which can estimate software energy consumption without any hardware instrumentation.    
As my research methodology, I frequently rely on mining software repositories (e.g., collecting bug-related data from open-source software repositories and then building bug prediction models with machine learning algorithms).

<font color="green">Prospective Students</font>
</h1>

<p align="justify">
I am seeking several PhD and MSc students for fully funded positions in software quality research, starting September 2025. Ideal candidates should have strong coding skills and problem-solving abilities. Experience in machine learning and software engineering is highly advantageous. Before reaching out, please review my research work to ensure alignment with your interests. If you do not receive a response by January 2025, it may indicate a mismatch between our research focuses and expertise. Successful candidates will be invited to participate in multiple one-hour interviews, during which I will evaluate your coding skills, knowledge of algorithms and data structures, and expertise in machine learning and software engineering. Please ensure that your email subject line reads "Prospective Graduate Student for Fall 2025."

</p>

<!--I am looking for one MSc. and one PhD student who are interested to work on different aspects of software quality. Students must be good at coding and problem solving, and they must have good analytical skills. Knowledge on software engineering research and machine learning would be very helpful. Students can start either from January 2024 (might be difficult due to visa processing time) or from September 2024. 
Please do some research about my work before sending me an email. For example, can you write something about "CodeShovel", "GreenScaler", and "GreenBundle"? 
What can you improve about them? How can you use machine learning to solve problems related to software quality?
-->
