                    SQM Research Lab is committed to assisting software practitioners in developing energy-efficient (green computing), bug-free, and maintainable software. We also create tools to push the boundaries of software engineering research. Our research is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the University of Manitoba.

<strong>We are currently offering two openings for PhD positions starting in September 2026 (can be January 2026 if you are a national student)</strong>. If you're interested in joining our team, please reach out to Dr. Shaiful Chowdhury at shaiful.chowdhury at umanitoba.ca. Be sure to explain your motivation for wanting to work with us and attach your CV. If we think you are a good fit, we will come back to you by December 2024. Please ensure that your email subject line reads "Prospective Graduate Student for Fall 2025."
